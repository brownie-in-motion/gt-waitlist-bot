# GT Waitlist Bot

Monitors full waitlists for open spots.

This is among the goriest code I have ever written. It also became useless to
me as soon as I finished. The Abstract Algebra waitlist moves fast, I guess.

## Usage

Since I'm lazy, this has no permissions set up and does not work for multiple
guilds.

- Set the bot ID and guild ID in `config.json`.
- Run with `TOKEN=<token>` in environment variables.
- Use `/set` to set the announcement channel.
- Use `/menu` to create the menu.
